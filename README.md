# Tensorflow 1. Cookbook

This is the Jupyter Notebook where I try to practice Tensorlfow Cookbook examples.

Run `docker-compose up` to start the Jupyter Notebook, then hit localhost:8888 in your browser with the token that it prints out.

You must intall tensorflow in the container and update numpy:

```bash
pip install --update numpy
pip install tensorflow
```
